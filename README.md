# Sketch Ipsum

A basic Data Plugin for Sketch, that fills your text layers with random Lorem Ipsum.

Just for fun, it uses a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) generator to randomise the text (thanks @kevincennis for sharing an implementation in https://gist.github.com/kevincennis/5440878)
